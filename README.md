# Favorite-movies

A simple js app using an omdbapi.com api key to fetch movies. The app can also save the user's favorite movies in a MongoDB database. 

You need a web server like Apache Tomcat to run the front-end and Node.js to run the back-end. You also need a MongoDB Atlas database. Download the app and run the command 'npm install' to install the modules. Run the web server and run the app with the command 'node app.js'. 

When the app is running, you can enter a title of a movie. The app is making an api call after a few secons and returns the details of the movie, if found. You can expand the details by clicking on the designated button. You can save the movie in the 'favorites' and view them when clicking on the appropriate button. You can also navigate to the movie in the IMDB website by clicking on the appropriate button.
